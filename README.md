# esp32-melody-generator
ESP32 based PWM melody generator for passive buzzers. Includes structured melody playback, hardware scale test, and modular note data for embedded audio experimentation.
The buzzer produces sound when driven by a rectangular (square) wave signal from the ESP32.
The frequency of the square wave directly determines the pitch of the tone produced.
Higher output frequency results in higher audible pitch, while lower frequency produces lower tones. Thus giving you some pretty cool sounds!
